                    <p> <b>Confused whether to buy from Amazon or Flipkart? </b>
                    <br> <br> 
                    Well, so were we. E-commerce websites pricing model revolves around offering the most competitive prices to customers, which means, the prices donâ€™t stay constant and change dynamically. It is important to check and compare prices before purchasing any product. <br> <br>
                     So we decided to build a scraper that extracts data from both the Ecommerce sites and monitors and compares their prices. 
                    We have added a search bar to compare prices for any product, and an analysis section which shows plots of data we collected for a month.  Check out the insights at last to see our conclusions based on the same!</p>
